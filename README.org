* Dotfiles
A place to keep dot files consistent across my machines. Uses gnu stow.

** Install
Special instructions for awesome wm. see below.

*** For Awesome
For some reason awesome wm has a bug when i use the dot- naming convention, so we don't use the --dotfiles option for this case.
#+begin_src bash
stow awesome
#+end_src

*** For Everything Else

#+begin_src bash
stow --dotfiles ${thing-ya-wanna-install}
#+end_src

** Debugging
   Run xdg-ninja to look for unwanted files in the home dir.
