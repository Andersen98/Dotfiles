 The following environment variables contain the string "tex"
 (case-independent).  If you're doing anything but adding personal
 directories to the system paths, they may well cause trouble somewhere
 while running TeX.  If you encounter problems, try unsetting them.
 
 Please ignore spurious matches unrelated to TeX. (To omit this check,
 set the environment variable TEXLIVE_INSTALL_ENV_NOCHECK.)
